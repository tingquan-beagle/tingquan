# A-Board-firmware
Contains the codebase for the Accessory Board.

## How to use:
1. Open the folder containing the .ini file in VSCode, and ensure you have the Platform IO extension installed.
2. Connect the horizontal USB on the board and the press the upload button to upload code.
3. The codebase uses the 'Arduino framework'. So all Arduino associated commands like 'digitalWrite()' can be used here.

## About the files
1. Main.cpp contains the primary logic of the code. You may add more cpp files in the same directory to extend functionality/organise code.
2. include/hardwarePins.h contains definitions for physical pins on the board. Do not edit this file unless necessary.
3. Under the lib directory- CANbus, FourTwenty, Relay, MicroSD are high level driver i.e to be directly used in the main.cpp file.
4. INA237 and MCP_DAC are low level drivers that are used for creating high level drivers. Avoid using any functions from these in the main program.
5. To create a new library of high-level functions create a folder in the lib directory, do that it looks like this:
```
project
└───lib
    └───ExampleLib
        │   exampleLib.h
        │   exampleLib.cpp
  ...
```
